	<h2>Class format</h2>
	<p>This module is divided into three blocks:</p><ol><li><a href="#intro">Overview and building programmable game machines</a>.</li><li><a href="#examples">The development of games and programming languages</a>.</li><li><a href="#cycle">Game engines</a>.</li></ol>	

	<h3 id="intro">Block 1: Overview and building programmable machines</h3>
	<p>In this block:<ul>
	<li>the metaphor of the tower block;</li>
	<li>building a foundation of understanding layer by layer;</li>
	<li>the practical application of this knowledge in a game context; and,</li>
	<li>exercises to test your understanding.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h3 id="examples">Block 2: The development of games and programming languages</h3>
	<p>In this block:<ul>
	<li>development of new generations of languages;</li>
	<li>applying these languages to replicate earlier designs; and,</li>
	<li>exercises to test your understanding.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h3 id="cycle">Block 3: Game engines</h3>
	<p>In this block:<ul>
	<li>development of game engines as simulators;</li>
	<li>continuing the development of programming in simulators; and,</li>
	<li>exercises to test your understanding.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h2>Dyslexia and learning difficulties</h2>
	<p><ul>
	<li>Make sure you have contacted Disability & Dyslexia Support (DDS).</li>
	<li>Programming is particularly hard on your eyes.</li>
	<li>The programs we're using in this module are customisable for font and background colour.</li>
	<li>Whether you have dyslexia or not, configuring your system can reduce eye strain.</li>
	<li>My preferred font is <span class="citation">Microsoft Consolas</span>.</li>
	<li>If you prefer to change the font, ensure that it clearly distinguishes the following characters:<ul>
		<li>1 I l |</li>
		<li>0 O</li>
		<li>' "</li>
		<li>: ;</li>
		<li>. ,</li>
		<li>() {} [] &lt;&gt;</li></ul></li></ul></p>

	<h2>The tower block</h2>
	<p>The programming body of knowledge:<ul>
	<li>Too big to cover is 36 hours.</li>
	<li>10,000 hours (5-6 years) practice become an expert.</li>
	<li>Concepts build on each other.</li>
	<li>There is a core of self-similar principles.</li></ul></p>

	<h2>Project management</h2>
	<p>You will be expected to manage your own time:<ul>
	<li>Maintain a log of everything you do.</li>
	<li>Estimate the duration of tasks based on previously logged times.</li>
	<li>Produce schedules for planned work to keep your workload manageable.</li></ul></p>


	<h2>Exercises</h2>
	<p>In most weeks you will be expected to complete exercises:<ul>
	<li>They should not take long.</li>
	<li>You may complete them during class time - if you're quick.</li>
	<li>If you get stuck, ask for help.</li></ul></p>

	<h2>Source control</h2>
	<p><ul>
	<li>A collaborative database for source files.</li>
	<li>It preserves version history.</li>
	<li>It has tools to manage the merging of source files.</li>
	<li>All of your files for exercises and work logs should submitted to it.</li>
	<li>The source control system we are using in this module is called <span class="citation">subversion</span>.</li>
	<li>Our server is hosted by <span class="citation">Google Code</span>.</li>
	<li>Your introductory class will cover this system and how to use it.</li></ul></p>
	
	<h2>Game project</h2>
	<p>You will create a game for your assessment:<ul>
	<li>small scope;</li>
	<li>work alone or in teams;</li>
	<li>build in Unity;</li>
	<li>should demonstrate your understanding of programming concepts;</li>
	<li>focus on custom programmed behaviour of game objects;</li>
	<li>polished art, design, or audio is not required;</li></ul></p>

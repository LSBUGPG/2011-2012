Step 1:

Created a cube where when a ball passes through it, it will trigger a function to play a sound
on collision but it will also cause cube2 on the scene to destroy.

What Happened

Ever happen according to play, instead of stating in the script how long to wait I've could have
included a yield function.



Step 2:

Create a cube on the scene that when the ball passes through, it will trigger a function to look for a 
music source within the main camera and play it, I've also addeds a debug to check if it is working
properly.

What Happened

Everything happen according to plan, but I've could have also added this function within one off the
others one and create a call function that whent he cube passes through cube 3 the function can be 
enabled.



Step 3:

This time instead I wanted to create a more challenging script where I want one object to send
message to another object and make it do a particulary function. Therefore I create a script called 
"Caller" where I placed a OncollisionEnter function then that when ever this object (Ball) collides 
with another object (Cube1) then I want it to find the object "Cube5" and execute the custom function
"Call" within that script.

Therefore I created another Script within "Cube5" and called it Reciever where basicaly first I
assasigned a texture when this function get called but also I've created a custom function called
"function Call" where basically I stated that when ever this function gets called then the texture must
changed but I also want to add a rigidbody cuasing the ball to fall mid air. However since I didn't
want this to happen suddenly I added a yield to make it wait for 3 seconds.

What Happened

Every happen according to plan, and I'm extremely satisfied with the results.

Week 11 OOP Exercise

Scripts:

BarrierControl: No frills here, you hit the "space" key and the barrier kills itself; releasing
the balls.

BouncingBall: Initially I intended for the balls to change colour on collision, 
but i found this very difficult to implement. At this current point in time,
the ball's colour changes to green after 15 "seconds". If I were to re-write this script,
I would write an array for the colours and get the balls to chnage colour on collision or
after different periods of time had elapsed.

DynamiteBall: The balls "explode" (destroy themselves and instantiate a particle effect in their
respective place) if the user presses the "e" key. If I were to re-write this script, I 
would have some sort of visual timer indicating how long before the ball would explode.

DuplicatingBall: The balls instantiate a large number of clones when the user presses the 
"e" key. I would like to have had more control over the number of clones that would be instantiated,
however i found the implementation of a random range difficult to script on a key press.

ExplosionBall: The balls "explode" after 13 "seconds", I would have preferred them to have
exploded upon collision with the other balls, perhaps affecting their trajectory.

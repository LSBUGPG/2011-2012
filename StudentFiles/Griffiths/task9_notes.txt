Improvements -
1. If stand on purple button waiting, the light won't switch on again.
2. If purple light is still on at the time, the light colours mix rather than the orange light overriding the purple light.
3. Green button could appear momentarily after the red.
4. The purple and orange buttons move very fast, could be slower to show the movement. 
5. Could happen slightly slower. 
6. Light could turn on more gradually. Text could be larger and exact centre screen.
